# ConnectionLogger
Simple and lightweight plugin for bukkit which provides logging player connects and disconnects

## Why should I use plugin for logging connections?
Generally, you can use logs for security reasons, or just for statistics (for example, average time of session on your server)
What will you use these logs for is up to you :)

## Why ConnectionLogger?
* It's easy to configure
* It's lightweight
* Asynchronous logging - connections are not affected by performance of logging
* Support across many versions of Bukkit/Spigot - even for future versions, so you don't have to update all the time
